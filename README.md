Hai there, Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
I am a beginner in computer programming and am currently learning Python.
I like to build and troubleshoot computers.
Here I publish some of my Projects that I have written in python which I would like to share with you.
I am self-taught and am looking for your opinion .
Please feel free to write to me to adhulrajkr@gmail.com

Thank You
